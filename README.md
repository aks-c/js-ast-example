# js-ast-example
example of one way to dynamically create js script tags. uses ASTs.

you have a JS string that you want to generate dynamically.
instead of a hard-to-debug JS string, you can instead write real JS code, and programatically stringify it with whatever parameters you like.

you can do that using ASTs.
